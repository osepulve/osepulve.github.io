I am an engineer and scientist passionate about natural flows. My research focuses on field-based experimental studies in environmental fluid mechanics. I aim to understand aquatic physical processes and their ecological responses (and vice versa) by combining innovative field measurement techniques—such as microstructure turbulence and underwater gliders—with modeling.

Current research interests include (i) the effects of basin-scale gyres on lake water heterogeneity, (ii) under-ice boundary layer turbulence, and (iii) the fate of turbidity currents.

I also contribute to polar research by applying my expertise in complex field measurements through collaborations in the Canadian High Arctic and the Amundsen Sea in Antarctica.
