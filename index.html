My research focuses on field-based experimental studies in environmental fluid mechanics. I aim to understand aquatic physical processes and their ecological responses (and vice versa) by combining innovative field measurement techniques—such as microstructure turbulence and underwater gliders—with modeling.</p> <p>Current research interests include (i) the effects of basin-scale gyres on lake water heterogeneity, (ii) under-ice boundary layer turbulence, and (iii) the fate of turbidity currents.</p> <p>I also contribute to polar research by applying my expertise in complex field measurements through collaborations in the Canadian High Arctic and the Amundsen Sea in Antarctica.</p> </body></html>
